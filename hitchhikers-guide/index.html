                Did you know? The answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Chapter 1: The Basics</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome, traveler! The internet is a vast, mostly harmless place where information flows 
                like digital water. Remember your towel - you'll need it for the unexpected twists and turns 
                of cyberspace.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Chapter 2: Navigating the Digital Cosmos</h2>
            <p>
                Much like navigating the Vogon Constructor Fleets, traversing the internet requires 
                patience and a good sense of direction. URLs are your coordinates, and search engines 
                are your Infinite Improbability Drive.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Chapter 3: The Babel Fish of Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Online communication is like having a Babel fish in your ear - suddenly everyone speaks 
                your language, though sometimes things get lost in translation. Emojis are the new 
                universal language.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Chapter 4: The Restaurant at the End of the Internet</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike Milliways, the internet never truly ends. There's always one more link to follow, 
                one more video to watch, one more meme to share. Time dilation is real - you might 
                start browsing at 9 PM and suddenly it's 3 AM.
            </p>
            
            <div class="fun-fact">
                Pro tip: The most important rule of the internet is: Don't feed the trolls. They're 
                like Vogon poetry - best appreciated from a safe distance.
            </div>
            
            <h2>Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything Digital</h2>
            <p>
                The internet doesn't have all the answers, but it has most of them. Just remember: 
                not everything you read is true, and if something seems too good to be true, it probably 
                is. Unless it's cat videos. Those are always true.
