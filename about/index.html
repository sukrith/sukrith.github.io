                        Hello! I'm Sukrith Akula, a passionate maker and technology enthusiast based in New York City. 
                        I love exploring the intersection of creativity and technology, and I'm constantly working 
                        on new projects that challenge me to learn and grow.
                        This website serves as my personal space on the internet where I share my thoughts, 
                        projects, and experiences. I believe in the power of open source and love contributing 
                        to the community whenever I can.
                        With a background in [Your Field/Education], I specialize in [Your Skills/Expertise]. 
                        When I'm not working, you can find me [Your Hobbies/Interests].
